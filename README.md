# Astro 528 Lab 1

## Exercise 1
#### Goal:  Learn the basics of core development tools
For this first exercise, there will be very little coding, because we'll focus on getting used to using git, GitHub, Lynx Portal, Julia and the Pluto notebook environment.

Start at the course website where it offers [help getting setup to complete this lab using Lynx](https://psuastro528.github.io/Fall2025/tips/aci/initial_setup/).  A link that will trigger GitHub Classroom to create your private repository to start from was provided via Canvas.  
Once you get a terminal on Lynx (or your local machine if you prefer), clone _your_ repository (and not the generic lab1-start).  Then start julia and Pluto, open the Pluto notebook in ex1.jl and start working through ex1.jl.

## Exercise 2
#### Goal:  Experience the perils of floating point arithmetic
From Pluto, work through ex2.jl.

If you're running low on time, **please** quit this exercise early and make sure to **allow yourself 30 minutes for exercise 3 and submitting your repository**.

## Exercise 3
#### Goal:  Reflect on your goals for the semester
- Open the file named goals.md in your repository with a text editor.
- Using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), create headings for sections "My Experience" and "My Goals".
- Write one paragraph (1-5 sentences) about your previous programming experience.  Include a working link somewhere in the paragraph.
- Create a bulleted list of 2 or 3 goals for you to work towards during this course.  
- Create a bulleted list of 3-9 specific objectives for you to achieve during this course.  
- Remember to commit the file to your local repository and push it to your Github repository, so it will be included in the pull request that is used to submit your assignment.  
- Once you've pushed your code to GitHub, view a rendered version of your file on GitHub to make sure the formatting is as you intended.

## Submit your repository
#### Goal:  Learn how to push your commits to GitHub and create a pull request on GitHub.com
Once you're ready to commit and push your responses, look at the tip on the course website for [instructions on committing, pushing and submiting](https://psuastro528.github.io/Fall2025/tips/submitting/) your work.  You'll use these same steps for all future labs.
